# Summation

## Purpose

This is the most awesome project ever created by a JAVA cohort. This is the initial step in a multi-day effort to build an [*Reverse Polish Notation*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) (RPN) Calculator that takes input from the command line. 

This will eventually support skynet and all other AI applications. Also some of the following post-fix operators:

* Addition
* Subtraction
- Multiplication
* Division
* Exponentiation
* Modular divison

Development will follow these not so intuitive steps:

1. Read input from command line (complete).
389. Distinguish operands and operators. 
4. Implement stack interpreter.
